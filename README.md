## Welcome to Summit19

For attendees of the two hands-on sessions on Python and AI:

These are the session files for Engineering Summit 2019. In order to maximize the value of the session it is critical to follow along and get hands-on experience with the tools, techniques, and packages that we are going to be exploring together. Getting the environment and becoming somewhat familiar with Jupyter Notebook before your session will make for a much more pleasant and valuable experience. We want you to get the most out of your time!

## Prep work

Before the session we ask that you:

* Have <b>Anaconda</b> installed on your laptop.
*   Anaconda includes Python, Jupyter, the `conda` environment manager, and every library you will need for our session this week.
    * Download here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    * When Anaconda is installed, start it up and click on Install under Jupyter Notebook (not JupyterLab).
    * You have started up Jupyter Notebook and created a new notebook, or opened one of the ones from this repository (more later).
* Have familiarized yourself with Jupyter Notebook interface.
    * Watched this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&v=jZ952vChhuI) (~7 minutes) while you follow along in your own environment. Try:
        * Navigating between cells
        * Executing cells
        * Modifying a bit of code in cells, and re-executing them

## Files

Please download and access `Summit19_TestMe.ipynb`, at least. This notebook has a couple of lines of code to test your environment and a cell at the bottom which downloads the latest session content to `./dl`.

It is highly recommend you refresh your documents before your session(s) this week in case there are updates.
