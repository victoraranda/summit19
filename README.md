# Welcome to Summit19!

For attendees of the two hands-on sessions on Python and AI:

These are the `ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) session files for Engineering Summit 2019. In order to maximize the value of the session it is critical to follow along and get hands-on experience with the tools, techniques, and packages that we are going to be exploring together. Getting the environment and becoming somewhat familiar with Jupyter Notebook before your session will make for a much more pleasant and valuable experience. We want you to get the most out of your time!

## Preparation

Before the session:

* Have <b>Anaconda</b> installed on your laptop.
*   Anaconda includes Python, Jupyter, the `conda` environment manager, and every library you will need for our session this week.
    * Download here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    * When Anaconda is installed, start it up and click on Install under Jupyter Notebook (not JupyterLab).
    * You have started up Jupyter Notebook and created a new notebook, or opened one of the ones from this repository (more later).
* Have familiarized yourself with Jupyter Notebook interface.
    * Watched this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&v=jZ952vChhuI) (~7 minutes) while you follow along in your own environment. Try:
        * Navigating between cells
        * Executing cells
        * Modifying a bit of code in cells, and re-executing them

## Files

NOTE: The files on GitHub are only the Jupyter Notebooks - the data files or images are not provided here.

NOTE EVEN HARDER: You will be emailed a DropBox link (Monday 2/11) which contains a zip file of ***ALL FILES YOU NEED FOR THE SESSIONS***, including data files and images. The file is `summit19.zip`.

# Updating Files

If I update the content, and you need to refresh your Notebooks, you have three options:
* Use `git` and to clone this repository. Just make sure that you get your original `./img/` and `./data/` into the same folder as the updated notebooks.
* Use the "poor man's git" in `Summit19_TestMe.ipynb`, which has a cell at the bottom that will download the latest session content (notebooks only) to `./dl` relative to where the originating notebook lives.
* Ask me or Juan for assistance.

If you get your stuff working, please help your fellow attendees if they're having trouble so that we can all follow along.

Thanks!

~~It is highly recommend you refresh your documents before your session(s) this week in case there are updates.~~ unlikely, but possible.
